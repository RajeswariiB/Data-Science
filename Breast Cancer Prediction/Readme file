# Breast Cancer Dataset Classification Algorithm

## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook file contains code for a classification algorithm using the Breast Cancer dataset. The algorithm utilizes various machine learning models to predict the presence of breast cancer based on input features.

### Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- plotly.express
- sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
- sklearn.metrics (confusion_matrix, f1_score, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score)
- sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression
- sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier

### Setup:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Install required libraries by running the following commands:
  
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
    

### Running the Code:
1. Download the 'Breast_Cancer_dataset_classification_algorithm.ipynb' file.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook.
3. Upload the downloaded file to your Jupyter environment.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially. Some cells may require data loading, ensure the dataset is in the same directory or provide the correct path.
5. Explore the code comments for understanding each step and modification options.
6. Experiment with different models by modifying parameters or using different algorithms available in sklearn.
7. Utilize the metrics provided to evaluate the performance of each model.

### Important Notes:
- Dataset: This algorithm uses the Breast Cancer dataset. Ensure the dataset is accessible and correctly loaded.
- Model Evaluation: The code includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- Modifications: Feel free to experiment with different models, feature engineering, or hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
